					<p>Buri Baras Beach sits on Buri Island, roughly 10–12 km from Catbalogan’s city proper — reachable via an embankment/bridge that links the island to the mainland. It offers a long coastal stretch that’s ideal for swimming and diving, making it one of the most loved coastal escapes for both locals and tourists.</p>
					
					<p>What’s nice about Buri Baras is its chill, easy‑going vibe: water quality is generally good, and there are affordable cottages for overnight stays or day‑use — a solid choice whether you’re bonding with family, friends, or just need a solo nature fix. Even when the sand isn’t the classic “white‑beach” type, the beach still draws people because of the calm waters and peaceful setting.</p>
					
					<p>Beyond just “swim‑and‑tan,” Buri Baras serves as part of a broader tourism push for Buri Island: local initiatives aim to balance tourism with ecological awareness — there have been efforts to develop the island sustainably, combining community livelihood, mangrove‑conservation and tourism amenities. It’s not just a beach; it’s like a little gateway to chill, nature, and a slower island‑life vibe — good for resetting and low‑key adventures.</p>
