					<p>The Parish of St. Bartholomew in Catbalogan City is one of the oldest churches in Samar, established way back in 1616 by Jesuit missionaries. Dedicated to Saint Bartholomew the Apostle, the parish became the spiritual center for the early fishing community in the city. Over the centuries, the church has faced multiple fires and reconstructions, with major rebuilds occurring in 1814 and again after another fire in 1835 under the Franciscans.</p>
					
					<p>Today, the church’s current structure retains only a few remnants of its original colonial design, but it still houses the centuries-old statue of its patron saint inside the rectory. The parish remains a vital part of Catbalogan’s religious life, celebrating its feast day every August 24 with the colorful Manaragat Festival, which honors the city’s fishing heritage and vibrant community spirit.</p>
					
					<p>It’s more than just a church—it’s a living piece of Catbalogan’s history, blending centuries-old traditions with the everyday life of the city.</p>
