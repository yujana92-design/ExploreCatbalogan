					<p>Pieta Park was created as a memorial to honor the victims of MV Doña Paz tragedy (1987) — considered the deadliest peacetime maritime disaster in history.Its main feature was a marble replica of La Pietà, which many locals and families of the victims treated as a symbol of remembrance and mourning. The park sits right across from St. Bartholomew Church — making it a central, visible part of the city’s public/historic core.</p>
					
					<p>Unfortunately — and this is heavy — the park was recently demolished in 2025. The city government says demolition work started without proper permits. Many residents were shocked and outraged because the memorial — especially the La Pietà statue — held deep emotional and cultural significance for Catbalogan. The statute was reportedly damaged in the process (the head of Mary was removed, among other destruction). 
</p>
					
					<p>The justification given by the church authorities — who own the land — was that the park had deteriorated over the years and become neglected, even described as a dumpsite or unmaintained space before the demolition initiative. Still — a lot of locals view this act as a loss of heritage, a painful erasure of collective memory tied to a tragic event that deeply affected the community.
