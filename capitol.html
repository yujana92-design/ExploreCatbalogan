					<p>The Capitol building was built in the 1930s in a neoclassical architectural style — think tall columns, symmetrical structure, and that “official‑government building” vibe. Because of this design, it stands out as a historic and aesthetic landmark: a throwback to old‑school prestige and governance.</p>
					
					<p>Over time, the Capitol hasn’t been just a pretty building — it’s been the seat of local power and a witness to major historical changes for Samar. It hosts the offices of the provincial government (including the governor and legislative body Samar Provincial Board) that shape laws, budgets and development plans for the province.</p>
					
					<p>It’s also a community landmark. People go catch sunrise or golden‑hour views from its grounds, stroll in its lawns, snap pics with the façade, or just chill nearby. Locals and visitors alike see it as a blend of heritage, civic life, and a kind of “Samar identity” anchor.</p>
